NDS (needs-driven services) ontology is based on DOLCE-CORE. The ontology aims to represent needs-driven services in OWL as a starting point that allows service designers to link needs to services by adopting a means-end reasoning perspective, focusing on citizens’ mental states. We have adopted a mental framework on needs, seeing ‘to need’ as an intentional verb that describes thoughts about entities that play the role of intentional object. Different senses of the term ‘need’ are distinguished and their relation with services is made explicit. Besides needs, the service designer can account for citizens’ mental states of desire about services. OWL engineering by Luca Biccheri with contributions by Daniele Porello and Roberta Ferrario.
